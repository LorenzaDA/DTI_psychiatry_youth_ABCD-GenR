# DTI_psychiatry_youth_ABCD-GenR
These scripts are related to the manuscript "Longitudinal associations between white matter microstructure and psychiatric symptoms in adolescence", publicly available at https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.27.22279298v1 

The scripts were used on the ABCD and Generation R datasets (ABCD: abcdstudy.org; GenR: generationr.nl). Please run the scripts per cohort and in sequential numerical order. The scripts for the meta-analyses and overall figures were run across cohorts, meaning that for steps 5 and 8, scripts in the "All" folder should be run.
